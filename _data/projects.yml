    Real time accident detection in video feeds using Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM cells. Trained on hand sampled clips from YouTube. Part of my bachelor thesis.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Built a deep learning model to detect car accidents in video clips
    --Implemented and tweaked YOLOv2 to detect cars in highway cams
    --Wrote scripts to scrape video clips from Youtube
    --Collected a data set of 200+ accident/non-accident videos
    --Preprocessed the data-set to lessen the burden on the machine
    --Explored pre trained models on the internet with the gathered videos
    --Experimented with a few DL models for classification
    --Implemented HRNN with LSTM to classify the video clips

    Python, Keras, Google Colabs

    Developed road safety application which warns users of road hazards in real-time
    --Implemented algorithms to detect road hazards using IMU sensors
    --Analyzed the IMU sensor trends from a bike driven on a bad road
    --Crowd-Sourced the detections to Firebase Cloud Database
    --Integrated voice assistance to warn the user if approaching the detection
    --Built the whole working app during a 24-hour hackathon conducted by
    --Internet and Mobile Association of India in which we won the 1st place 
    --Extended project doing experiments after the hackathon

    A Sentimental Analysis tool to analyze real-time trends of keywords in Twitter
    --Fetched Positive and Negative example sentences from online tutorials
    --Used Twitter API to fetch live tweets based on the keyword passed
    --Wrote functions to pass just adjective from the tweets into the classifiers
    --Classified the tweet based on the confidence of the classifiers put together
    --Built an interface window for the tool using TKinter
    --Integrated live graphical visualizations of the sentiments of the keyword

    An emergency train stopping cum Surveillance system designed for Indian Railways. Awarded as top 30 ideas by Amrita TBI- India's best Technological Business Incubator.  
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Built an emergency train stopping cum Surveillance system
    --Devised an emergency button-Cam module using RPi
    --The RPi module alerts the onboard authority when a button is triggered
    --The data is then broadcasted to authority’s device using a local network
    --Created by hot-spot to deal with network issues in remote areas
    --This data is then uploaded from the device to the cloud for official purposes
    --The project was placed in the top 30 ideas by Amrita TBI
    -- India’s best Technological Business Incubator
